    content: "Have a look at Thurso on a map - it may be a long journey but it's worth it! If you're planning to drive, you just need to hit the A9 at Perth and follow it to the end. Trains come all the way up to Thurso Train Station, but if you're planning to fly the closest airport is Inverness. Remember to leave a few hours for the last leg from Inverness to Thurso."

It's worth booking as far in advance as possible to ensure you get somewhere to stay. Don't limit yourself to Thurso, there will be more accomodation options available in the surrounding area."
