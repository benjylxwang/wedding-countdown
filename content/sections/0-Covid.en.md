    "As you know, it's difficult to know what the situation will be like in the summer. As such, please be aware that all the plans for the wedding are subject to change.",
    "In particular, it's highly possible that the number of people we can have at the wedding will be limited, and so we're planning on live streaming the wedding so that those who cannot make it in person due to travel or wedding size restrictions can still join us virtually.",
    "More information about the current UK and Scotland government policies relating to the COVID-19 pandemic can be found at the links below."
